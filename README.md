### Reflection 1
I tried to keep the code clean by using meaningful names and separating the controller, service, and repository so each part handles its own job. for security, i used uuids instead of simple integers for product ids to make them harder to guess. looking back, i made a mistake using a get request to delete products which isn't safe, so i need to improve it by changing it to a post request in the future.
